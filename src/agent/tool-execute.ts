/**
 * tool-execute — the execution machinery every server-side lh tool shares,
 * expressed natively (Wave A of the pi-native migration, 2026-09-26): tools
 * are authored as pi-agent-core AgentTools (TypeBox parameters, native
 * execute), and this module owns the semantics the old LhTool wrapper
 * (lh-tool.ts, deleted) used to add around every execute:
 *
 * - the system-level per-call timeout + abort cascade (runWithAbortGuard),
 * - the authoring-refinement failure shape (invalidInputResult —
 *   returned from execute as an isError result; pi 1.0's convention, the
 *   model sees the same retryable problem list it always did, and
 *   `details` keeps the problems as data),
 * - the result mapping (string verbatim / object JSON / image results to
 *   native content parts; details carries the record-facing value),
 * - the question-tool placeholder (quiz / ask_user_question): a synthetic
 *   "question posed" result that is NEVER persisted — the record keeps the
 *   tool part output-less until the client answers; the learner's answer
 *   re-enters the next turn as this call's result. terminate: true (owner
 *   Option A, 2026-09-25) ends single-question batches natively; the slim
 *   shouldStopAfterTurn stopper (teacher-agent.ts) holds the belt-and-
 *   suspenders rule for mixed batches.
 *
 * Structural validation is NOT here: pi's loop validates arguments against
 * the tool's TypeBox parameters before execute ever runs (pi-ai's
 * validateToolArguments — the fast TypeBox path). Refinements that no
 * schema can carry (quizInputProblems, the live-tree nodeId check) run at
 * the top of the tool's own execute and throw ToolInputError.

/**
 * System-level per-call timeout (2026-09-19, the abort-cascade fix): pi
 * passes every run's AbortSignal to tool execute, but the signal only
 * lands at a step boundary — so a long-running local tool (the grep that
 * outlived its turn by minutes) could hold the turn hostage until the dev
 * server's memory restart killed the run mid-tool, freezing the record at
 * its write-ahead state (the "went back in time" rollback). The guard
 * races every execute against (a) the run's signal and (b) this timeout,
 * rejecting with pi's own wording ("Operation aborted") on abort and a
 * clear timeout message otherwise — pi turns the throw into an error tool
 * result the model can see.
