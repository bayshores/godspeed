 * Names + levels + dating ONLY — no statement text, no session contents
 * (owner ruling: the map's ORGANIZATION is the prober's business, its

 * (graphSessionIndex / graphSessionPropositions) over the same ports the

 * disagree.
 *
 * Registered on the prober ONLY when the settings gate opens
 * (graphToolsEnabled — the graph master switch AND the agent.graphTools
 * toggle); the composition root decides, the factory just receives the
 * store (absent = the gate is closed, no map tools — tests drive this).

 *                     unlike the prober's names-only rule).
 *   list_sessions     the birth-session index, no timestamps.
 *   list_propositions full proposition text (same reasoning as find).
 *
 * No timestamps anywhere: identity work needs content, not chronology.
 * Read-only, pure core seams, same ports the snapshot reads.
