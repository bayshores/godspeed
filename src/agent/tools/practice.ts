/**
 * THE PRACTICE TOOLS: the session runs on `problem`
 * (pose: terminates the turn; the commitment rides the call's arguments,
 * hidden from the learner UI) and `conclude` (end the problem: normal
 * result, so closing words may follow; the next pose waits for the
 * learner's go-ahead). The rarely-used extras join in practiceTools. The gating law: an agent cannot pose while a problem is active
 * and cannot conclude with nothing active — activeProblemOf is the single
 * fold both gates read.
 *
 * Mechanics-only descriptions: the tool descriptions carry WHAT to pass
 * and WHAT happens — the theory, the commit-before-pose law, the hint
 * ladder all live in the system prompt (prompts/practice/10-doctrine.md).
