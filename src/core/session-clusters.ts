/**
 * BIRTH-SESSION CLUSTERING (wave 7, owner-locked 2026-09-23): embeddings
 * are dead — a proposition's cluster is the SESSION THAT CREATED IT,
 * derived deterministically from provenance. Cluster labels are session
 * names (the chat title or the imported file's path): no model call, no
 * key, no configuration. What the agglomerative pass grouped by MEANING
 * proximity, this groups by WHERE KNOWLEDGE WAS BORN — the owner's call
 * that the session that minted a set of propositions is the honest
 * "region of the world model" they belong to.
 *
 * Birth session (owner ruling 2026-09-23): a node's FIRST surviving
 * provenance point's chatId — the create line's first point at read time
 * (getGraph merges lines by id, first line defines, provenance unions in
 * line order — so provenance[0] is the birth point of the surviving
 * lines). This makes deletion self-healing with ZERO special handling:
 * delete-nodes strips a session's create lines and its provenance points;
 * a SURVIVING shared node re-attributes to its earliest remaining
 * contributor (provenance[0] walks forward), and a node left with NO
 * provenance at all is simply unclustered. The partition is derived on
 * every read — there is no persisted partition to invalidate.
 *
 * Notes imports are birth-sessions too (owner ruling 2026-09-23): their
 * nodes carry a "src_…" source id instead of a chat id; the caller labels
 * them with the file's path (kind: file in the session views). The old
 * mapping-line fallback for provenance-empty notes nodes is GONE (owner,
 * 2026-09-29): every merge writes provenance points, and the mappings
 * ledger itself died with per-job in-memory resolution — provenance is
 * the one birth record.
 *
 * Browser-safe pure logic (no node builtins, no fs): same contract style
 * as the rest of the core graph derivation. Not re-exported through the
 * core barrel — the shell reads clusters from the snapshot; only the
 * server-side derivations (snapshot, settle) and tests import this.
